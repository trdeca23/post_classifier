this is just a rant about the world. people in power should be fair. and people who aren't in power need to make the world better by caring. and caring means doing something to inform yourself and to talk about things that matter and to advocate and to help others too. that is what will create the right pressures to produce positive change that goes all the way up to the top. but really, what doe god fearing people think about this? anyway, i'm surely not the only one who is tired of hearing about trump and the usa.
